# Feather 🎵

Feather is a lightweight, efficient, and locally hosted YouTube Music TUI built with Rust. It is designed to provide a minimalistic yet powerful music streaming experience directly from YouTube, using `yt-dlp` and `mpv`.

## 🎯 Aim

A lightweight, ad-less player with only essential features.

## ✨ Features

- 🎶 **Stream YouTube Music** without downloading files.
- ⚡ **Minimal Memory Usage**, targeting **60MB - 80MB RAM**.
- 🚀 **Fast Playback**, with loading times around 3 seconds.
- 🖥️ **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** built using Ratatui.
- 🔄 **Self-Update Feature** (planned).

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📌 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- 🦀 **Rust** (latest stable version)
- 📥 **yt-dlp** (for fetching YouTube data)
- 🎵 **mpv** (for playback)

### 🔧 Build from Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/13unk0wn/Feather.git
cd Feather/feather_frontend
cargo build --release
```

### ▶️ Run Feather

```sh
./target/release/feather_frontend
```

## 🎮 Usage

Navigate through the TUI to search and play music. Additional controls and keyboard shortcuts will be documented soon.

### 🛠️ Handling YouTube Restrictions

If a song fails to play due to YouTube restrictions, you can bypass them by adding your cookies to the environment:

```sh
export FEATHER_COOKIES="paste your cookies here"
```

- This is **optional** and should only be used if playback errors occur.
- Feather can play songs without cookies, but adding them may help `mpv` bypass certain restrictions.
